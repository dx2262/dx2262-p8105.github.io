Here's the tidyverse.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

library(p8105.datasets)
```

Let's load the AirBnB dataset.

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb <- 
  nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(
    rating = review_scores_location / 2
  ) %>% 
  select(
    neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, 
    price, room_type, lat, long
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price >= 100, price <= 500
  )
```



Let's make a scatterplot!!! But interactive this time.

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)
  ) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, color = ~price,
    text = ~ label,
    type = "scatter", mode = "markers", alpha = 0.8
  )
```
